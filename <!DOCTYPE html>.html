        <p class="university-introduction">Shanhe University is not a traditional university, but an internet virtual university established by the people of Shanhe's four provinces (Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi) according to the situation of social education. It is a collective will and aspiration formed by students from these provinces, originating in June 2023. This school was established due to the lack of higher education resources in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces.</p>
